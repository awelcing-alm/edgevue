# Crested Geckos: The Velvet Clowns of the Reptile World

Crested geckos (*Correlophus ciliatus*) have become a favorite for reptile keepers, especially due to their lack of eyelids and unique “eyelash” ridges.

## Why They're Beloved

- **Low-maintenance diet**: Many thrive on a commercial powdered diet mixed with water.
- **Handleable yet jumpy**: Their “leaps of faith” are both endearing and amusing.
- **No heat required**: Room temperature (65-78°F) is generally sufficient.

## Key Details

- **Humidity**: 50-70%.
- **No UVB required**: Though some owners use UVB lighting for enrichment.
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years.
