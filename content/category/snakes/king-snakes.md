# King Snakes: The Unmatched Charmers of the Serpent World

King snakes (*Lampropeltis spp.*) are renowned for their striking colors and fearless attitude.

## Why They Stand Out

- **Immune to venom**: In the wild, they can hunt venomous snakes.
- **Vibrant patterns**: Famous for their black-and-white "banded" look, though morphs vary.
- **Adaptability**: Found across diverse habitats in North and Central America.

## Essential Care

- **Temperature range**: 75-80°F ambient, basking spot around 85-88°F.
- **Humidity**: 40-60%.
- **Diet**: Mice or small rats.
- **Lifespan**: 20-25 years with proper care.
