# Leopard Geckos: A Friendly Choice for Reptile Lovers

Leopard geckos (*Eublepharis macularius*) are one of the most popular pet lizards, beloved for their unique spotted appearance and low-maintenance care requirements.

## Why They’re a Top Choice

- **Beginner-friendly**: Their calm temperament makes them a great first reptile.
- **Low humidity needs**: Unlike many tropical lizards, they prefer arid environments.
- **No sticky feet!**: Unlike tree-dwelling geckos, they have clawed toes instead of sticky pads.
  
## Care Snapshot

- **Temperature gradient**: 75-85°F, with a basking spot of 88-92°F.
- **Humidity**: 30-40%.
- **Diet**: Insectivorous—enjoys crickets, mealworms, and dubia roaches.
- **Lifespan**: 10-20 years with proper care.
