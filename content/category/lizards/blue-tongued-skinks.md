# Blue-Tongued Skinks: The Charismatic Companions

Blue-tongued skinks (*Tiliqua spp.*) captivate keepers with their calm demeanor and signature blue tongues used to ward off predators.

## Why They’re Special

- **Docile nature**: They tolerate handling exceptionally well.
- **Omnivorous appetite**: They’ll happily eat vegetables, fruits, and protein sources like snails and lean meats.
- **Ground-dwellers**: They don't require climbing spaces like many other lizards.

## Essential Care

- **Basking temperature**: 90-100°F.
- **Cool side**: 70-80°F.
- **Humidity**: 30-40% (slightly higher for Indonesian species).
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years.
